## 2026-09-06 - Dynamic Curses Layouts and Vim Keybindings
**Learning:** Hardcoded coordinates in terminal UIs (like curses) can lead to visual bugs or misaligned cursors when input data lengths vary. Additionally, users expect standard terminal keybindings (like j/k for navigation) in TUI applications.
**Action:** Always calculate dynamic coordinates based on text lengths in curses applications and map standard terminal navigation keys alongside arrow keys.

## 2024-05-20 - Permanent Keyboard Shortcuts for TUI
**Learning:** In a curses-based TUI, ephemeral status messages can overwrite keyboard shortcut instructions, leaving the user without guidance.
**Action:** Always reserve a dedicated, persistent bottom row for core keyboard shortcuts so they are never obscured by temporary status updates.

## 2026-09-08 - Respecting NO_COLOR Standard in CLI
**Learning:** Terminal utilities that use ANSI escape codes for semantic formatting (like green for enabled, red for disabled) must provide a way to disable color output. This ensures accessibility for users with color vision deficiency or environments that don't support color rendering.
**Action:** Always check the `NO_COLOR` environment variable before applying ANSI escape codes in CLI tools.

## 2024-05-21 - Dimming and Truncating Metadata in CLI Lists
**Learning:** When printing long metadata strings (like 40-character commit hashes) in terminal lists, they create excessive visual noise that distracts from the core information.
**Action:** Truncate long metadata strings (e.g., to 7 characters) and use dim ANSI coloring (\e[2m) to reduce visual noise and maintain visual hierarchy, while respecting NO_COLOR.
